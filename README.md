# Keepchat

## What?

A small, unlisted, lazily-coded fabric mod that doesn't clear chat when you leave a server. It also:
- pings you when someone whispers to you (specifically when it says "whispers to you" in chat)
- extends chat history from 100 lines to 500 lines
- inverts chat scroll speed, so normal scrolling is slow and shift-scrolling is fast

Bugs:
- it will keep whatever chat was in the box, so if you leave one server and join another, the previous server's old chat will still be there.
